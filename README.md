# Description
I made this project back in 2022. The purpose was to use the output of the program to automate a IR data gathering process for a Large Scale Additive Manufacturing print and optimize its parameter to avoid errors. 
Below there are samples of how the app looks and the outputs it gives. The parser was used to create the origin points and timestamps for regions of interest (ROIs). 
The purpose was to pass that information on tho the software contolling the IR camera so it could create ROIs that could be activated and deactivated according to the timestams which correspond to the position of the gantry. 
I would have done many things differently now, but this is what I could do back then.
